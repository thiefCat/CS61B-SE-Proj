# CS61B-SE-Proj
This is the Project 3 (Software Engineering) of CS61B in UC Berkeley. I used java to implement a 2D tile-based world exploration engine, which is a 2D world where users can interact 
with the objects in that world.

## How to run
Open byow folder in your IDE, select SDK which is Java 17 or higher. Also include the Library library-sp23 to the project. Navigate to byow/Core/Main, and run it, then a window will show up:
